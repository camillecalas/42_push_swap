# 42 push_swap

### Brief :
This project involved sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. 

### Notes :
To make this happen, I had to manipulate various sorting algorithms and I picked Radix algorithm solution.

### Inputs :
- handeling inputs that look like "2 1 3 4 5" or 2 1 3 4 5

### Usage :

```
Make
```
```
./push_swap 2 1 3 4 5
```
